# 🖼️ Images for NutriBot - Quick Answer

## Will images make it heavy or destroy success?

### ❌ NO - If you do it RIGHT!

**The RIGHT way:** Store image URLs (just text)

- Fast queries: No performance impact
- Easy to update anytime

**The WRONG way:** Store actual images in database
- Database becomes huge: 20+ MB
- Slow queries: Users will complain
- Hard to manage

## 🤝 For Your Telugu/Hyderabad Users

Since you updated vegetables to use Telugu names like "Vankaya (Brinjal)", images are even MORE important because:
- Users recognize food visually
- Not everyone knows English names
- Pictures help with portion estimation
- Better for elderly users

**Pro tip:** Later, add Telugu text overlay on images for even better UX!
