# 90-Day Health Tracker - Project Status

## ✅ COMPLETED - Following Your Rules!

### Phase 1: DATABASE FIRST ✅
- ✅ Cleaned up database to **6 core tables**:
  1. **users** (30 rows) - Authentication
  2. **meals** (6 rows) - Diet tracking for 90 days
  3. **exercises** (7 rows) - Exercise tracking
  4. **sleep_records** (3 rows) - Sleep tracking
  5. **food_nutrition** (426+ rows) - Ready for 7,800+ Indian foods
  6. **user_sessions** - Session management

- ✅ Removed unnecessary tables:
  - steps (separate app)
  - playing_with_neon (test table)
  - meal_logs (duplicate)
  - water_intake (not needed)
  - weight_tracking (not needed)

- ✅ All tables use **INTEGER** primary keys (not UUID)
- ✅ Added **local_name** column for regional names (gadka, vankaya, etc.)
- ✅ Added **search_tags** column for better search

### Phase 2: BACKEND + MIDDLEWARE ✅
- ✅ Updated `schema.ts` to match database exactly
- ✅ Fixed all backend routes in `routes.ts`:
  - **Auth routes**: `/api/signup`, `/api/login`, `/api/logout`
  - **Meal routes**: `/api/meals`, `/api/meals/today`
  - **Exercise routes**: `/api/exercises`
  - **Sleep routes**: `/api/sleep`
  - **Dashboard**: `/api/dashboard/summary`
  - **Food search**: `/api/foods/search`

- ✅ Authentication middleware (`requireAuth`) - protects all routes
- ✅ Session management with `express-session` + PostgreSQL
- ✅ Password hashing with bcrypt

### Phase 3: FRONTEND ✅
- ✅ **Signup Page**: 3 fields (email, password, confirm password)
- ✅ **Login Page**: 2 fields (email, password)
